# K-Means Clustering Algorithm
Implementation of a K-Means Clustering machine learning algorithm.
## Background of K-Means Clustering Algorithm
Implementation of the K-Means algorithm in python, which allows you to turn an image displayed by lots of different colors into an image that contains a specific number of colors (k). This machine learning algorithm allows easy compression of the image.
